# Assignment 3

## Q1 : What role do you see for Project Managers in helping their organizations adopt and get value from Agile practices?
1.  In an agile environment , the responsibilities of traditional project managers change. Instead of controlling the playing field from a high level position, they practice horizontal management and constantly seek both internal and external feedback. This way , they are able to successfully react to emerging changes or issues in a timely manner.

2.  One aspect where the role of the project manager evolves the most is planning. In Agile , teams plan more on average, However it happens on multiple levels also known as roller wave planning. Instead of creating detailed plans and listing them on Gantt Charts. Agile PMs engage in colllaborative discussions to determine only the high level details based on what is known now. 

3.  Another aspect where the role of the project manager changes in Agile Environment lies within their collaboration with stakeholders. Agile PM's connect the dots between high level requirements and the day-to-day execution of the work on lower levels. They are responsible for setting up the vision of the projects, maintaining transperency and creates a shared understanding of what "Complete" looks like. 

## Q2 : What are the roles in Scrum? Describe what happens in the Sprint planning meeting.
### Roles in Scrum
**Product Owner :**
1.  The product owner represents the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer.
2.  The owner is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business.
3.  The owner also defines the product in customer-centric terms (typically user stories), adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies.
4.  Scrum teams should have one product owner.This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master.
5.  The product owner should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liasing with stakeholders and should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution.
6.  This role is equivalent to the customer representative role in some other agile frameworks such as extreme programming (XP).

**Development Team :**
1.  The development team is responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments (PSIs) of product at the end of each sprint.
2.  A team is made up of 3–9 individuals who do the actual work (analysis, design, develop, test, technical writing, etc.).
3.  Development teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills necessary to deliver a product increment.
4.  The development team in Scrum is self-organizing, even though there maybe interaction with other roles outside the team, such as a project
management office (PMO).

**Scrum Master :**
1.  Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.
2.  The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.
3.  The scrum master ensures that the Scrum framework is followed.
4.  The scrum master helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes in the Scrum framework, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve.
5.  The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator or servant-leader to reinforce these dual perspectives.

### Sprint Planning
A sprint planning meeting consists of 
1.  Communicating the scope of work that is intended to be done during the sprint.
2.  Selecting product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint.
3.  Prepare a sprint backlog that includes the work needed to complete the selected product backlog items.

For example : The recommended duration for sprint planning is 4 hours for a two-week sprint.
1.  During the first half, the whole scrum team (development team, scrum master and product owner) selects the product backlog items they believe could be completed in that sprint.
2.  During the second half , the development team identifies the detailed work required to complete those product backlog items, resulting in a confirmed sprint backlog.
3.  Once the development team has prepared their sprint backlog, they forecast (usually by voting) which tasks will be delivered within the sprint.

## Q3 : What is a burn down chart? What does a scrum burn down chart comprise?
The burndown chart is a very fundamental metric in agile scrum. It helps the team to track the progress, since it shows the progress on a daily bases, it helps the scrum master to predict if a team will be able to achieve the target.
It is a graphical representation of error remaining over a period of time. It helps the team to track the effort which should be reduced on daily basis.

### Scrum Burndown Chart Compositions
**1.  Total Estimate :** It is the sum of efforts in hours of all the user-stories,tickets and issues,basically its the total number of works in hours to which the team is committed to.

**2.  Amount of work remaining or effort remaining :** This is what burn down shows and this is how this graph get its name, in literal meaning its the “effort burndown chart”. The Team will burndown some effort each day so that on last day of sprint or release there is no work effort remains.

**3.  Working Days :** Since team need to calculate and carefully work on the commit item each day, so that is the reason total days of commitment of work are shown in graph. This is the total working days in a sprint (excluding holidays, weekend, etc). This is actually the sprint duration.

**4.  Ideal Effort :** The ideal effort is drawn as a guide for a team, its drawn by calculating the exact amount of effort remaining which team need to burndown. That is the reason you see a very straight line from the top of Y-axis to X-axis, which is the last day of your sprint.

**5.  Real Effort :** Effort remaining line varies from team to team and day to day. It depends on how much effort remaining is added or reduced each day. If more items(user stories and issues) are added after the sprint started, this show as an upward spike.


## Q4 : Explain what is a product backlog in Scrum?
1.  The product backlog comprises an ordered list of requirements that a scrum team maintains for a product. It consists of feautures , bug fixes , non-functional requirements or any requirements that must be done to sucessfully deliver a viable product.
2.  The product owner prioritizes those product backlog items (PBI) is based on considerations such as risk , business value , dependencies, size and date needed.
3.  Items added to a backlog are commonly written in story format.
4.  The product backlog is what will be delivered,ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered.
5.  It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.


## Q5 : What do you mean by FDD? How would agile modeling be applied on an FDD project?
**Feature Driven Development** is an iterative and incremental software development process. It is one of a number of lightweight or Agile methods for developing software.
FDD blends a number of industry-recognized best practices into a cohesive whole. These practices are all driven from a client-valued functionality (feature) perspective. Its main purpose is to deliver tangible, working software repeatedly in a timely manner.

FDD is a model driven short iteration process that consists of five basic activities. For accurate state reporting and keeping track of the software development project,milestones that mark the progress made on each feature are defined.

**Plan by Feature**

After the feature list is completed, the next step is to produce the development plan; assigning ownership of features (or feature sets) as classes to programmers


**Design by feature**
1.  A design package is produced for each feature.
2.  A chief programmer selects a small group of features that are to be developed within two weeks.
3.  Together with the corresponding class owners, the chief programmer works out detailed sequence diagrams for each feature and refines the overall model.
4.  Next, the class and method prologues are written and finally a design inspection is held.


**Build by Feature**
1.  After a successful design inspection as per feature activity to produce a completed client-valued function (feature) is planned.
2.  The class owners, each develop code for their classes.
3.  After unit testing and successful code inspection, the completed feature is promoted to the main build.

**Develop overall model**
1.  The FDD project starts with a high-level walkthrough of the scope of the system and its context.
2.  Next, detailed domain models are created for each modeling area by small groups and presented for peer review.
3.  One of the proposed models, or a combination of them, is selected to become the model for each domain area.
4.  Domain area models are progressively merged into an overall model.

**Build feature list**
1.  The knowledge gathered during the initial modeling is used to identify a list of features, by functionally decomposing the domain into subject areas.
2.  Subject areas each contain business activities, and the steps within each business activity form the basis for a categorized feature list.
3.  Features in this respect are small pieces of client-valued functions expressed in the form "<action> <result> <object>", for example: 'Calculate the total of a sale' or 'Validate the password of a user'.
4.  Features should not take more than two weeks to complete, else they should be broken down into smaller pieces.
