# Assignment 3

# Q1- You are in the middle of the sprint and the product owner has come with one new requirement from the customer, what you do? What is the best way to handle it?
# Q2- What is the definition of Ready and Definition of Done(DOD)?
## Definition of Done (DOD)
Definition of Done (DOD) is a list of requirements that a user story must adhere to for the teamm to call it complete. It is structured as a list of items, each one used to validate a story or PBI, which exists to ensure that the development team agrees about the quality of worl they are attempting to produce. It also serves as a checklist that is used to check either each product backlog item or user story for completeness. Items in the definition of "Done" are intended to be applicable to all items in the product backlog, not just a single user story. 

### Goals of Definition of Done:
1. Build a common understanding within the Team about Quality and Completeness.
2. Use as a checklist that user stories are checked against.
3. Ensure the increment shipped at the end of the Spring has high quality and that the quality is well understood by all involved.

## Definition of Ready (DOR)
Ready is the state of a backlog item should have before it is eligible to be pulled into a sprint. In order for a backlog item to be ready, it needs to be valuable, actionable, feasible, and most importantly everyone has to have a shared understanding of it.

### Benifits of Ready
1. It optimizes collobaration, getting backlog items to ready encourages collaboration because it requires everyone to focus on the product when creating user stories, and ensure a share understanding of them.
2. It prevents waste, when creating a user story, the team focuses on what it should be and what it should not, preventing waste from assumptions.
3. It enables a smooth flow, by increasing understandability of a user story, then the variability is reduced, this means a smooth flow of work and progress.
4. It increases team domain knowledge, the more the team understands what the product should be, the more likely they will contribute to innovation and value creation, and therefore the more the team conversation are more productive.


# Q3- What are the best practices of estimating user stories?
In software development, an estimate consists of a quantified evaluation of the effort necessary to carry out a given development task. This is most often expressed in terms of duration.

The intent is to aggregate many such individuals estimates, so as to obtain an indication of the overall duration, effort or cost of a software project.
