Write a brief about XP ( Extreme Programming ) practices in the Agile Model

# Answer

## Definition
Extreme Programming is a discipline of software development based on values of simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, and respect. It works by bringing the whole team together in the presence of simple practices, with enough feedback to enable the team to see where they are and to tune the practices to their unique situation.

There are various XP practices , they are as follows 

  1. The Planning Game
  2. Small Releases
  3. Metaphor
  4. Simple Design
  5. Testing
  6. Refactoring
  7. Pair Programming
  8. Collective Ownership
  9. Continuous Integration

## Planning Game

XP planning addresses two key questions in software development: predicting what will be accomplished by the due date, and determining what to do next.The emphasis is on steering the project – which is quite straightforward – rather than on exact prediction of what will be needed and how long it will take – which is quite difficult. There are two key planning steps in XP, addressing these two questions:

### Release Planning
It is a practice where the Customer presents the desired features to the programmers, and the programmers estimate their difficulty. With the cost estimates in hand, and with knowledge of the importance of the features, the Customer lays out a plan for the project.

### Iteration Planning
It is a practice whereby the team is given direction every couple of weeks. XP teams build software in two-week “iterations”, delivering running useful software at the end of each iteration.
